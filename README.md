Bookmarked
==========

Bookmarked is a barebones bookmarking application supporting multiple user authentication. It provides a simple interface that lists your saved bookmarks and has a bookmarklet to unobtrusively save webpages.

Ideally you would run Bookmarked on a public server so the bookmarklet is most useful and your saved bookmarks are accessible from multiple devices.

## Requirements
- PHP 5.3+ with PDO
- SQLite3

## Why?

With all the bookmarking services out there, why this? Because most bookmarklets are obtrusive (requires input), which interrupts my otherwise rapid consumption of web content. Bookmarked simply saves a list of URLs and page names so it's fast to save and fast to load and without extraneous features.

If you are so inclined, Bookmarked provides the API and framework to build your own bookmarking service on top of it.
